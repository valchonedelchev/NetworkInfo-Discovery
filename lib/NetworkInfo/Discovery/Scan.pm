=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<NetworkInfo::Discovery::Scan> is a host/port scanner that is used to
find hosts that are too quiet for C<NetworkInfo::Discovery::Sniff> to
find.
It is a detection module subclassed from C<NetworkInfo::Discovery::Detect>.
We can probe tcp or udp ports.
There is the ability to set a timeout on the connection so that we don't
wait all day for the scan to finish.
There is a wait attribute that keeps us from scanning the network too fast
and affecting it in a negetive manner.
The hosts attribute takes hostnames, ipaddresses, or CIDR-like network/bitmask
lists.

=head1 METHODS

=pod

=over 4

=item new

returns a new Scan object, and takes the arguments shown in this example:

    $obj = NetworkInfo::Discovery::Scan->new(
	    hosts     =>    ["hostname", "1.2.3.4", "4.3.2.1/26"],
	    [protocol =>    ("tcp"|"udp")],
	    [timeout  =>    3 ],    #in seconds
	    [wait     =>    100],   #in miliseconds
	    [ports    =>    [80,23,100..300] ],
	);

timeout is the amount of time to wait in seconds  before giving up on a connection attempt.
wait is how long to wait in miliseconds  between each probe.
protocol is either tcp or udp -- we will only try to connect to that type of port.
hosts is an array ref of hosts to try.  The CIDR-like addresses will be expanded out
(i.e., 172.16.1.129/24 is really 172.16.1.(0-255)).  If this type of addres is used, we
do not scan the top and bottom of the range, as this should be the network and broadcast addresses.
ports is and arrey ref of numeric ports to scan for each host.

=item do_it

Runs the scan, builds up hosts out of what we found open, and returns the hostlist.

=item hosts ([$aref]

Builds up our list of hosts to scan, or returns that list.
The aref can contain any of the following:
    "hostname"
    "1.2.3.4"
    "1.2.3.4/26"

The CIDR-like address will be expanded into an address range and all the
hosts in that range (minus the top one, and the bottom one) will be
added to the host list to be scanned.

Runs a tcp or udp scan against the hosts in our host list.  This method
uses alarm if you have set the "timeout" attribute, so please keep that
in mind and don't use your own alarm while running this.
